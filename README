Hi Herman T H,
Due to new regulation regarding cryptocurrencies introduced by the Dutch government, we have made some changes to how cryptocurrency withdrawals work at Bitstamp.
The new regulation requires us to collect proof that you are the owner of any third-party wallet or exchange account before you can withdraw crypto to it.
This is not as complicated as it sounds, it simply means that, before you can withdraw crypto from Bitstamp to an outside address, you have to add that address to your whitelist and provide a photo that proves it really is your address. You can do this from the Bitstamp web page.
Starting on Friday, 15 January 2021, at 00:00 UTC, withdrawal whitelisting in your account has been automatically enabled. This means you now have to add each cryptocurrency address to your whitelist before you can send crypto to it. Whitelisting is a security feature which was already available at Bitstamp, but now it has become obligatory for all customers affected by the new regulation in the Netherlands.
This also means that withdrawals from your Bitstamp account directly to third parties are no longer allowed. You have to withdraw crypto from Bitstamp to your own wallet first if you want to send it to any third parties.
Thank you for your support in this matter. As a regulated exchange, Bitstamp Europe S.A. has been required to make these changes in order to continue serving you, however, we believe the solution we are implementing is as simple and easy to use as possible, while ensuring the highest security standards for your assets.
Best,
The Bitstamp Team
